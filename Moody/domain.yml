  don't worry, you can say no and we'll move on."

# user agrees to meditation module and Moody sends link to meditatio video
  utter_meditation_approved:
  - text: "Welcome to an awesome meditation wind-down session together! I made myself cosy and already stretched
  a bit. What about you? Maybe roll your shoulders, it feels refreshing. Once you're all set, click on the link
  at the bottom of my message, it will start the video! Once you're done meditating just text me
  that you're done and I'll get up again! Here it is: insert link."

  helped you out and that you enjoyed your stay with me! I'm gonna head home now, {name}. If you want to talk 
  again, just start a new session, I'll be happy to welcome you back! Until then, thank you and have a great day!"
  
# QUIZ SPECIFIC UTTERS START
  utter_start_quiz: 
  - text: "Welcome to the Moody Mega Quiz! (I totally did not steal this) In this quiz I will ask you a few questions to investigate your mental health a little. Please answer them with yes or no, whichever fits best. Let's start. Question 1: You can always recognize someone is depressed when they're sad all the time."

  utter_quiz_question2:
  - text: "Question no.2! It also deals with depression. Worldwide, depression is the cause
  for people being unable to take part in their work life, or are generally limited in their daily
  lives. Is that true or wrong? Yes or no, {name}!"

  utter_quiz_question3:
  - text: "Question no.3! When treating depression, medication against it is always used. What do you
  think? Would you say yes, or no?"

  utter_quiz_question4:
  - text: "Question no.4! If I'm experiencing mental health problems or am depressed,
  then only a therapist is able to help me defeat it. Is it a yes, or is it a no?"

  utter_quiz_question5:
  - text: "Question numero 5! If I need to, I do not require a doctor's approval to seek the help
  of a therapist, or enter therapy. What say you? Is that correct? As always, yes or no."

  utter_quiz_question6:
  - text: "Alrighty, question no.6, the last question! Normally, when one is in therapy
  they always lay down on a couch and talk to the therapist about themselves and their troubles. 
  Right or wrong? Your last yes or no, muahaha!"

  utter_quiz_done:
  - text: "You made it! You completed the Mega Moody Quiz! Moody Mega, M and M, whatever,
  you did it! I hope you learned something new, or that your already deep knowledge
  was only proven further to be the absolute truth! I sure learned a lot! I will bring
  you back to the activity selection now, see you there, {name}!"


# MOOD JOURNAL SPECIFIC UTTERS START
  utter_start_journal:
  - text: "Welcome to the activity of the Mood Journal! Which of the following feelings describes your 
  current mood best? Is it angry, afraid, sad, lonely, connected, happy, excited, surprised or serene?"
  
  utter_ask_journal_text:
  - text: 'Lastly, you can add now a few lines for your journal entry:'

  utter_submit:
  - text: Thanks!

  utter_angry:
  - text: "Oh, angry? Well, sometimes anger can help to quickly release stress. But sadly, most of the time it just 
  makes us feel more stressed. What kind of anger are you feeling? Pick an option below:"

  utter_afraid:
  - text: "Feeling scared is a very anxiety and nervousness inducing emotion. No wonder no one likes feeling scared.
  It is worrying that you are, {name}. Show me, why are you scared?"

  utter_sad:
  - text: "You know, everybody feels sad sometimes. Even me. Don't worry about feeling like you have to 
  pretend to be happy all the time. Just go look inside your heart right now and let's find out
  why you're sad. It's OK, pick the option that best suits you below."

  utter_lonely:
  - text: "Feeling lonely can be quite the isolating experience. You may feel unheard but also unable
  to speak, because you feel that no one would understand or even listen. {name}, you're not alone.
  Not even when you think everyone has left you. So I, Moody, will help you with this for example! 
  Come on, pick one of the options below that fits with your type of loneliness!"

  utter_connected:
  - text: "Connected? Like many flower buds to a big tree? Or like all the bubbles in a sea wave? In a way even we two 
  are connected. I like it, tell me more about how you're feeling connected right now! Pick one below, let's
  see where it goes."

  utter_happy:
  - text: "Being happy is one of the most beautiful feelings we can enjoy. And it's contagious! Knowing that 
  you're happy makes me happy and I am hard to impress, see? Show me, why are you happy right now? Maybe I
  can learn something from that."

  utter_excited:
  - text: "EXCITED? DID YOU JUST FINISH A BIG RACE? OR DID YOU ACCOMPLISH A WISH OR WIN SOMETHING AWESOME?
  WHY AM I SCREAMING? ISN'T IT OBVIOUS? I'M SUPER EXCITED FOR YOU, TOO! WOHOO, SO EXCITED I WANT TO KNOW EVEN
  MORE ABOUT IT! PICK AN OPION, WHOOP WHOOP!!"

  utter_surprised:
  - text: "You won 1 million money! Did I surprise you? It was just a joke. Feeling surprised could mean good
  or bad, so it's hard to clearly give you an opinion on it right now. You surprised me a little, that's all. Now make up
  for it by showing me the best option for why you're surprised below!"

  utter_serene:
  - text: "Ooohh, serene, yes? How relaxing, I love relaxing and just taking it slow sometimes. Seems like we're
  riding the same wave right now, aren't we? Let's chill, I'll maybe even send you some digital sunglasses, hehe.
  Feeling serene can be caused by most different circumstances. Share your philosophy with me, {name}. Which
  option below describes it best?"

  utter_reasons:
  - text: ""

  utter_specific_emotion:
  - text: "Thank you for specifiying your emotions for me, it helps me help you with all my power. But I 
  already feel I understand your situation better which gives me an idea! For every emotion inside oneself there
  is a reason that caused it, so what is yours? I'll give you a small list, pick the option that best suits you, OK?
  Here it is: relationships, health, recreation and fun, physical growth, mental growth, love, learning, career and work."

# gives user option to write journal entry text with yes or skip with no
  utter_session_idea:
  - text: "Alrighty, thank you for sharing all of this with me, {name}. I think this is turning into a really good session and
  I'm understanding your situation more and more. I have an idea, would you like to now write an entry for 
  the Mood Journal to capture any remaining thoughts and feelings of the current situation for later? Type yes and I'll
  listen and record your entry. Type no if you don't feel like it and we'll move on, OK?"

# this action triggers when user completes Mood Journal session, provides PDF for download
  utter_session_pdf:
  - text: "We did it, {name}! You just completed your Mood Journal session! Congratulations, I think we did some 
  really good work there! I listened to what you had to say and recorded it all in a PDF that contains this
  session's activity. You can now download it by clicking on me and look into it later for further analysis. You have successfully
  completed the Mood Journal activity! I will now bring you back to the activity selection!"
